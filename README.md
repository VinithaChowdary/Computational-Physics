Thus project was done in the 1st Semester for the subject Computational Physics.  Question 1: Tension and Moment of Force in a Pyramid Shaped Metal Container A pyramid-shaped metal container weighing 3500 N is suspended by three ropes from a crane. The project involves calculating the tension in each of the three ropes (AB, AC, and AD) and the moment of force about the point A.

Question 2: Arrow and Rotating Target Simulation
This part of the project simulates a scenario where a target revolves at a constant speed around an arrow. The objective is for the arrow to hit the rotating target. The simulation includes several interactive commands and visual feedback. It also calculates the score. 

Commands:

Start: Initiates the target's rotation.
Stop: Halts the target's rotation.
Shoot: Launches the arrow towards the target.
Reset: Resets the arrow's position for a new trial.
User Interaction:

When the arrow enters the range of the target, "HIT!!" is displayed.
The user must reset the arrow position after each trial to attempt a new shot.

This project utilizes principles of computational physics to solve real-world problems involving force, tension, and motion. The first question focuses on static equilibrium and vector calculations, while the second question implements a dynamic simulation requiring user interaction and real-time feedback. The project showcases the application of computational methods to analyze and solve physics-based problems efficiently.
